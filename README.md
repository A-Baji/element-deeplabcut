# DataJoint Element - DeepLabCut

This repository features a DataJoint schema for pose estimation via 
[***DeepLabCut***](https://www.deeplabcut.org/).
The pipeline presented here is not a complete pipeline by itself, but rather a modular
design of tables and dependencies specific to the behavior tracking workflow. This
modular pipeline element can be flexibly attached downstream to any particular design
of experiment session, thus assembling a fully functional behavior pipeline (see the
example [workflow-deeplabcut](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-deeplabcut)).
